// A clique cover of a graph G may be seen as a graph coloring of the complement graph of G
// the graph on the same vertex set that has edges between non-adjacent vertices of G.
// Like clique covers, graph colorings are partitions of the set of vertices,
// but into subsets with no adjacencies (independent sets) rather than cliques.
// A subset of vertices is a clique in G if and only if it is an independent set in the complement of G,
// so a partition of the vertices of G is a clique cover of G if and only if it is a coloring of the complement of G.

// minimum clique cover -> minimum graph coloring of the complement graph -> chromatic number of complement graph
